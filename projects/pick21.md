## Pick21 Solitaire

Pick21 is a solitaire game similar to those found on MegaTouch bar top games that are no longer manufactured.

This game has no ads, does not collect any information, and is made available free of charge simply because I wanted it available to the world. I wanted this game to exist, pure and simple.

## Gameplay

Gameplay is simple:

Using the cards in the shoe (upper left corner), place cards in one of the five columns, attempting to get each column as close to the score of 21 as possible.

The total value of all 5 columns is then added up and multiplied by the time remaining on the timer to determine your final score:

- 105 = Time x 1000
- 104 = Time x 500
- 103 = Time x 400 
- 102 = Time x 300 
- 101 = Time x 250 
- 100 = Time x 200 
- 99 = Time x 150 
- 98 = Time x 100 
- 97 = Time x 50

After three rounds, the score is totaled, and you're free to play again.
